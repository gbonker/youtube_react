# YouTube App with React

This application uses React.js to allow the user to search for YouTube videos. It calls the YouTube API, parses the response, and displays the first five search results to the user in an intuitive and responsive way. It uses LoDash to delay calling the YouTube API while the user is searching so that the user does not get overwhelmed with too many updates to the displayed search results.

### Getting Started

To get started with this repo, simply clone it or download the zip, cd into the directory, and run:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

The app can then be viewed in by typing "http://localhost:8080/" into the browser.
